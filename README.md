## Problem Statement
In many developing countries, ensuring menstrual hygiene for women and girls during emergencies poses a critical challenge. The issue at hand is the lack of accessible services that allow women to obtain menstrual hygiene products when they are in urgent need, especially in situations where they do not have money readily available. This gap in essential services significantly jeopardizes the well-being and dignity of women and girls, hindering their ability to manage their menstrual hygiene effectively and comfortably. Addressing this problem is vital to safeguarding the health, safety, and overall quality of life for women and girls in these regions. Providing free pads to women, aims to bridge this gap and ensure that no woman is left without essential menstrual hygiene products during emergencies.
